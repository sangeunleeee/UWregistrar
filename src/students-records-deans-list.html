					<h2>Dean's List</h2>
					<h3>Have you qualified for the Dean's List?</h3>
					<p>
						Students qualify for the Dean's List if they have attained a quarterly GPA of 3.5 in their final grades for at least 12 graded credits and are matriculated undergraduate students pursuing their first undergraduate degree. A student's quarterly Dean's List status is part of their permanent academic record, and is indicated on transcripts.
					</p>
					<p>
						A list of Dean's List recipients for the previous quarter is available online on the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/students/qtrdean" class="links">Student Guide's Quarterly Dean's List</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						As well, students who have qualified for the quarterly Dean's List will receive email notification of a Dean's List letter. These letters are generated once per quarter, a few weeks after grades are due for that quarter. Dean's List letters are only generated and available for students who met the Dean's List criteria at the time the letters were generated. Dean's List letters are not updated based on late changes to the academic record.
					</p>
