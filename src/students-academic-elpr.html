						<h3>Qualifying Washington Associate Degrees</h3>
						<p>
							An approved academic associate degree from a Washington community college is defined as the sending institution's direct transfer agreement associate degree (DTA). Qualifying degrees (often titled as an Associate of Arts or an Associate of Arts and Sciences) are those that are recorded on an official community college transcript with a designation of "DTA." The associate of science transfer degree is also a qualifying degree. The degree must be conferred prior to enrolling at the UW.
						</p>
						<h3>Take AEP course if not qualified above</h3>
						<p>
							Students who do not enter the UW with qualifying standardized test scores or program completion as described above, and who are not native English language speakers will be required to complete one or more required courses through the Academic English Program (AEP). Students with AEP course requirements must continue to register for these courses each succeeding quarter until the prescribed sequence of courses is completed. Get more information at the <a href="http://www.outreach.washington.edu/aep/">AEP website</a>.
						</p>
						<h3>What happens if a student fails the AEP course a second time</h3>
						<p>For those students who enter the Academic English Program (AEP) it is imperative that the courses they test into be completed satisfactorily early in the student's academic career. Therefore, effective autumn quarter 2010, an undergraduate student may repeat an English 101, 102, 103 or 104 course once. If the student fails the course a second time, a hold will be placed on the student's registration and the student will do one of the following:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Take an approved standardized test or AEP Placement Test that places them into the next level of AEP or satisfies the requirement completely;</li>
							<li>Successfully complete the Intensive English Program (IEP);</li>
							<li>Drop out for a quarter and take an approved standardized test or AEP Placement Test after a time away that places them into the next level of AEP or satisfies the requirement completely.</li>
